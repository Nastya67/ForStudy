Maria, Curie, was, born, in, Warsaw, on, the, 7th, of, November, 1867.
Her, father, was, a, teacher, of, science, and, mathematics, in, school, the, town, from, him, little, Maria, Sklodovska, which, her, Polish, name, learnt, first, lessons.
Maria, wanted, to, study, at, the, Sorbonne, in, Paris, and, after, many, years, of, waiting, she, finally, left, her, native, land, for, 1891.
In, Paris, Maria, began, a, course, of, hard, study, and, simple, living.
She, determined, to, work, for, two, Masters, degrees, one, in, physics, the, other, mathematics.
So, she, had, to, work, twice, as, hard, any, other, student.
Yet, she, did, not, have, enough, money, to, live, on, and, soon, her, strength, was, weakened, because, had, no, proper, food, warmth.
She, lived, in, a, small, room, the, poorest, part, of, Paris.
Night, after, night, her, hard, days, work, at, the, University, she, would, climb, to, poorly, furnished, room, and, books, for, hours.
Her, meals, were, poor, sometimes, no, more, than, a, few, cherries, which, she, ate, as, studied.
Though, she, was, often, weak, and, ill, under, this, hard, life, worked, in, way, for, four, years.
Nothing, could, turn, her, from, the, way, she, had, chosen.
Among, the, many, scientists, Maria, met, and, worked, with, in, Paris, was, one, Pierre, Curie.
Pierre, Curie, born, in, 1859, Paris, was, the, son, of, a, doctor, and, from, his, childhood, he, interested, science.
At, sixteen, he, was, a, Bachelor, of, Science, and, took, his, Masters, degree, in, physics, when, eighteen.
When, he, met, Maria, Sklodovska, was, thirtyfive, years, old, and, already, famous, in, Europe, for, his, discoveries, magnetism.
But, in, spite, of, the, honour, he, had, brought, to, France, by, his, discoveries, French, Government, could, only, give, him, a, very, small, salary, and, University, Paris, refused, laboratory, own, for, research, work.
Pierre, Curie, and, Maria, Sklodovska, loved, science, more, than, anything, else.
Very, soon, they, became, the, closest, friends.
They, always, worked, together, and, discussed, the, many, problems, of, their, work.
After, a, little, more, than, year, they, fell, in, love, with, each, other, and, 1895, Maria, Sklodovska, became, Madame, Curie.
By, this, time, Maria, Curie, had, got, her, Masters, degree, in, physics, and, mathematics, was, busy, with, research, on, steel.
She, now, wanted, to, get, a, Doctors, degree.
For, some, time, Pierre, and, Maria, Curie, were, interested, in, the, work, of, a, French, scientist, named, Becquerel.
There, is, a, metal, called, uranium, which, as, Becquerel, discovered, emits, rays, very, much, like, Xrays.
These, rays, made, marks, on, a, photographic, plate, when, it, was, covered, in, black, paper.
The, Curies, kept, wondering, about, these, rays, of, uranium.
There, were, many, questions, that, puzzled, Maria, Curie, and, her, husband.
Here, they, decided, was, the, subject, for, Marias, Doctors, thesis.
The, research, was, carried, out, under, great, difficulty.
Madame, Curie, had, to, use, an, old, storeroom, at, the, University, as, her, laboratory, she, was, refused, a, better, room.
Here, it, was, cold, there, np, proper, apparatus, and, the, room, too, small, for, research, work.
But, Maria, Curie, had, to, make, the, best, of, it.
Soon, she, discovered, that, the, mysterious, rays, of, uranium, were, much, more, peculiar, than, believed.
They, were, like, no, other, known, rays.
Maria, Curie, began, to, examine, every, known, chemical, body.
After, repeating, her, experiments, time, after, she, found, that, a, mineral, called, pitchblende, emitted, much, more, powerful, rays, than, any, had.
As, Maria, Curie, had, examined, every, known, chemical, element, and, none, of, them, emitted, such, powerful, rays, as, pitchblende, she, could, only, decide, that, this, mineral, must, contain, some, new.
Here, was, a, mystery.
Scientists, had, said, that, every, element, was, already, known, to, them.
But, all, Maria, Curies, experiments, proved, one, thing.
Pitchblende, must, contain, some, new, and, unknown, element.
There, was, no, other, explanation, for, the, powerful, rays, which, it, emitted.
Scientists, call, the, property, of, giving, out, such, rays, radioactivity, and, Madame, Curie, decided, to, new, element, radium, because, it, was, more, strongly, radioactive, than, any, known, metal.
Madame, CurieSklodovska, died, in, 1934.
She, was, the, leading, woman, scientist, greatest, of, her, time, and, first, person, who, received, Nobel, Prize, twice.
